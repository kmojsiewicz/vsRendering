Software rendering of primitives (Visual Studio & OpenGL)

## Description

Textures are loaded from bitmap files.
Vertices can be read from OBJ files.
Matrix operations were used to rotate and display the object : rotation around the Z axis,
rotation around the X axis, translation and projection.
Filling the triangles is done by interpolating the colors of the vertices 
or using textures with a fast algorithm without using floating-point numbers.
Pixel setting is done directly on memory.
